# The Founding Purpose
To draw attention to each person’s own emotions developed from any form of cinema and changes of oneself through the cinematic experience: {watching, digesting and evolving}, with the aim of countering evaluation of cinema by mass media, SNS, and critics of acclaimed journals.

Moon’s Choice Awards serves to highlight the importance of personal emotions and changes through the cinematic experience which differs from person to person because of the fact that every person has their own distinct background and identity. The Choice focuses on works that have personal impacts on Moon, the one and only jury of the Choice, and are guaranteed to make very personal choices but to have a strong impact on the meanings of watching films around the world.

# And the Choice goes to...
# 2014
## Her
Can you even imagine that your loved one actually loves more than 100 people including you but still makes you feel like the only one? That does not sound so crazy and funny in the near future, the time when an operating system would have a perfect and unique human personality just like us. Do you ever remember how painful it was when you found out that the one you loved turned out to be loving someone else too? Samantha loved 672 more guys. Imagine the pain that Theodore has to go through. Multiply 672 to the pain you got last time. It would give you shock, a heart attack, dyspnoea and make you cry in the middle of a subway stairs.
## Let The Right One In
Yeah she’s a bitch, but you can’t help but love her, because she’s bloody attractive. She is an experienced expert. She knows when to come up, move and get you. But you are young.  You are not experienced at all. So you love her, even if it leads to your death, but you can’t care no more.
## Mommy _ Xavier Dolan
Feelings are hard to describe. And this film is all about feelings. This film chooses to use the square screen ratio which is relatively smaller than some usual screen ratios we are familiar with, and therefore had to decide what to put into the small, focused screen. And that was feelings. We can pick up some worthy properties of this movie. The right songs at the right time, and how effective the square is, and how blessed we are when the square expands to a rectangle.
## Captain America : Winter Soldier
Action should always serve a certain purpose. Action can reveal character, move a story forward and tell emotions. Never use Action for itself. It is fun to watch it in the middle of films. But when the end credits appear, it is all but emptiness you are left to feel, because you wasted your time.
# 2015
## Inglorious Bastards
The very first time I thought, a movie can be fucking cool.
## Whiplash
The intensity. It is like someone keeps slapping you in your face to make you keep focus.
## Ted
Thunder buddy forever.
# 2016
## Zootopia
This is a story about animals and after you watch this, you would see this is actually a story about us, adults.
## Captain America : Civil War
It was like a real fight we usually have with our friends. There are no logical explanations or reasons for those, but still we end up fighting, hurting each other’s feelings. It is just a little push that makes us lose it. It is human. So don’t try to defend one from the other. And this is what Marvel was really clever about: make the fight like a real fight between close friends.
## The Martian
Humor makes movies great. He never loses his laugh but still makes us cry.
## Mad Max : Fury Road
I always pick the following 3 pictures for the all-time best action films. The Rock, the Bourne series, and this Mad Max. You can see how much effort the filmmaker put in this movie.
## Spotlight
There are some darkest truths that are need to be spotlighted. 
## Lalaland
For being such a magical cinema that we don’t have anymore these days. This one is a historical movie. Songs will be remembered forever. Truly Magical. No one knows LA’s most beautiful places more than the director, Damien Chazelle. LA citizens sometimes forget that LA’s freeways are a huge part of LA. But Damien was there for us.  However, LA citizens all know the Griffith Observatory is the most beautiful place in LA even though the place is pretty popular, and that’s why Sebastian and Mia laugh when they are at the observatory again for the 3rd time. Shoot 360 degrees of a scene when you shoot under sunset, because the first 180 degree would be scenes background filled with navy from light to dark, but the other 180 degree would be those filled with from light pink to dark pink. Even walking is dramatic in this way. If you are planning to shoot musicians performing, see the following movies: La La Land and Whiplash. If you think your works are well-organized with a bunch of colors that are intentionally used to make your works look more artistic ,cool or whatever, you are wrong. Colors in your works just make eyes sick and make people (especially me) feel uncomfortable. Go see what the director of La La Land achieved with colors. One tip: put some enough grey (highway) in the background. Lastly, turn off lights, highlight or focus on someone just like plays in theaters. And! don’t forget to turn on the lights again.
# 2017
## Thor: Ragnarok
Lovely characters are the real assets that Marvel Cinematics Universe has at this time.  Short-cut Thor, Slicked-back hair Hella, Chatty Hulk, eccentric Grandmaster and my Valkyrie revived once too classic series based on a myth and redesigned it. A small tweak of an idea made a real difference. A colorful discotic comedy Thor movie gave me absolutely delightful time. Especially the theme song, the two scenes with the eheheh sound were the most chilling moments of the year. I say Ragnarok is one of top 3 best MCU movies along with Civil War and Winter Soldier.
# 2018
* Since the one and only jury of the Choice was serving his country in the military as a drill instructor for the 15th Infantry Division of Republic of Korea, from June 2017 to March 2019, very few films and shows were appreciated at this period of time.
## 남자친구 (ENCOUNTER), 2018~2019
Korean La La Land , Don Quixote and Sleeping Beauty all put in a one show.
# 2019
## Unicorn Store
Unicorns are real.
## The Little Prince _ Mark Osborne
All grown-ups were once children, but only few of them remember that. The biggest problem of the world is that too many people grow up.
## The Farewell
The happiest twist we have all waited for.
## Parasite
Arguably the best film of the decade if we score movies like a test. 
## Toy Story 4
There was another story to tell. But would there be more?
# 2020
* Since the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the film industry in 2020, very few new films/shows were released and therefore appreciated at this period of time.
## Knives Out
This is what movies are for: Original story-telling that is captivating, funny with some twists.
## Peanut Butter Falcon
Anyone can wrestle and become a good friend to a nice person.
## 2001: A Space Odyssey
The Odyssey is not for those who want short and quick answers in no time. This movie here from 1968 (note that UNIX development was started in 1969) makes you think, confused and leave with the historic theme song by Richard Strauss. The song represents the greatness and the theme of this film, but you may have a different opinion. The production design eclipses most of the films from this century. Great space films such as Martian, Interstellar, Ad Astra or Gravity tried to show off their own imagination of how space travel and life would look like in future but only achieve the goal with marginal improvement from the Odyssey. The Odyssey changed the whole game 50 years ago. The Odyssey is definitely ahead of its time in that the visual is still stunning and the questions that it throws cannot be more relevant today. Stanley Kubrick is just an amazing guy.

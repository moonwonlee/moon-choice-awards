Moon’s Choice Awards serves to highlight the importance of personal emotions and changes through the cinematic experience which differs from person to person due to the fact that every person has own distinct background and identity.

# And the Choice goes to...
# 2014
## Her
When you find out she has 672 more guys who she loves, the damage you get is increased by the scale of linear function. And that would be real in the near future, the time when OS would have a perfect unique human personality just like us. Do you ever remember how painful it was when you found out the one you loved turned out to be loving someone else too? Samantha loved 672 more guys.
Let The Right One In
She’s a bitch, but you have no choice but to love her, because she’s bloody attractive. She is an experienced expert. She knows when to come up move and get you. But you must be young.  you are not experienced at all like her. So you love her. That would lead you to death. But you wouldn’t care no more.
## Mommy _ Xavier Dolan
Feelings are hard to describe. And this film is all about feelings. This film chooses to use the square screen ratio which is relatively smaller than some usual screen ratios we are familiar with, and therefore had to decide what to put into the small, focused screen. And that was feelings. We can pick up some worthy properties of this movie. The right songs at the right time, and how effective the square is, and how blessed we are when the square expands to a rectangle.
Captain America : Winter Soldier
Action for story. No more movies for action (Transformers). I love captain’s action because he’s human after all.
# 2015
## Inglorious Bastards
The very first time I thought, a movie can be fucking cool.
## Whiplash
The intensity.
## Ted
I love Ted.
# 2016
## Zootopia
More than an animal kingdom happy happy story.
## Captain America : Civil War
It was like a real fight with friends: there was no reason to fight, but we did, because we didn’t talk, so feelings got hurt. 
## The Martian
Humor makes movie great. And the positivity throughout the whole movie keeps us happy.
## Mad Max : Fury Road
I always pick the following 3 pictures for the best action movies. The Rock, Bourne, and this. You can see how much effort they put in this movie.
## Spotlight
There are some darkest truths that are need to be spotlighted. 
## Lalaland
Historical movie. Songs will be remembered. The movie is going to be referenced. Truly Magical. No one knows LA’s most beautiful places more than the director. LA citizens sometimes forget this but he knows that LA’s freeway is a huge part of LA.  However, LA citizens all know the Griffith Observatory is the most beautiful place in LA even though the place is pretty popular, and that’s why Sebastian and Mia laughs when they are at the observatory again for the 3rd time. Shoot 360 degree of a scene when you shoot under sunset, because the first 180 degree would be scenes background filled with navy from light to dark, but the other 180 degree would be those filled with from light pink to dark pink. Even walking is dramatic in this way. If you are planning to shoot musicians performing, see following movies: Lalaland and Whiplash. If you think your works are well-organized with bunch of colors that are intentionally used to make your works look more artistic ,cool or whatever, you are wrong. Colors in your works just make eyes sick and make people (especially me) feel uncomfortable. Go see what the director of Lalaland achieved with colors. One tip: put some enough grey (highway) in the background. Lastly, turn off lights, highlight or focus on someone just like plays in theaters. And! don’t forget to turn on lights again.
# 2017
## Thor: Ragnarok
Lovely characters are the real assests that Marvel Cinematics Universe has at this time.  Short-cut Thor, Slicked-back hair Hella, Chatty Hulk, eccentic Grandmaster and my Valkyrie revived once too classic series based on a myth and redesigned it. A small tweak of an idea made a real difference. A colorful discotic comedy Thor movie gave me absolutely delightful time. Specially the theme song, the two scenes with the eheheh sound were the most chilling moments of the year. I say Ragnarok is one of top 3 best MCU movies with Civil War and Winter Soldier.
# 2018
* Since the one and only jury of the Choice was serving his country in the military as a drill instructor for the 15th Infantry Division of Republic of Korea, from June 2017 to March 2019, very few films and shows were appreciated at this period of time.
## 남자친구 (ENCOUNTER), 2018~2019
Korean Laland, Don Quijote and Sleeping Beauty.

## Unicorn Store
